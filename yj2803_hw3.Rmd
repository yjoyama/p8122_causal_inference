# 1. Interpret parameters
$C$: Obesity ($p=1/5$ of the mice are obese at baseline)    
$A$: Exposure to light  
$Y$: Glucose outcome such that $Y\sim N(\mu_Y, \sigma)$, where $E(\mu_Y)= f(\beta_0+\beta_1*obesity+\beta_2*light)$, $\beta_0=110, \beta_1=20, \text{ and } \beta_2=-5$   
  
$p$: The probability of a mouse to be obese at baseline. Theoretically, 3.2 out of 16 mice are obese. In the simulation by the above R code, 3 out of 16 mice are set to be obese at baseline.  
$\theta_0$: The probability for a non-obese mouse ($C=0$) to be exposed to light. $\theta_0=1/2$ means that there's a 50% chance for a non-obese mouse to be exposed to light.   
$\theta_1$: Describes how more (or less) likely it is for an obese mouse ($C=1$) to be exposed to light. $\theta_1=-1/5$ indicates that obese mice are 20% less likely to be exposed to the light. In other words, there's a 30% chance for an obese mouse to be exposed to light.     
$\beta_0$: The baseline mean glucose level for non-obese mice that are not exposed to light, which was set to be 110 mg/dL.   
$\beta_1$: The coefficient of obesity on glucose level. $\beta_1=20$ indicates that obese mice have 20 mg/dL higher average glucose level from the baseline compared to non-obese mice, holding other variables constant.       
$\beta_2$: The coefficient of light on glucose level. $\beta_2=-5$ suggests that mice with exposure to light have 5 mg/dL lower average glucose level from the baseline compared to non-exposed mice, holding other variables constant.
